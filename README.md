## Description

The Tkinter Calculator Application is a basic calculator implemented using Python and the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- User-friendly interface with buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and additional functions.
- Real-time calculation and display of results.
- Error handling for invalid mathematical expressions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- tkinter 0.1.0

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/momikich/Calculator-App.git
   cd Calculator-App
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies (if needed):**
   The application relies on Python and the built-in Tkinter library, which is typically included with most Python installations.
   ```bash
   pip install tk==0.1.0
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python Calculator_App.py
   ```

4. **Calculator Interface:**
   - The calculator window displays an entry field at the top for input and result display.
   - Buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a decimal point (.), equals (=), and a clear button (C) are available.

5. **Perform Calculations:**
   - Click the buttons to input digits and operators.
   - Click the "=" button to calculate the result.
   - Click the "C" button to clear the entry field.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - If an invalid mathematical expression is entered, the calculator will display an "Error" message.

7. **Exit the Calculator:**
   - Close the calculator window to exit the application.

## Notes

- This calculator is a basic example and may not handle advanced mathematical expressions.
- Feel free to customize and extend the functionality based on your requirements.
